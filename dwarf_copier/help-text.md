Dwarf Copy
==========

Copies files from the Dwarf II telescope to a PC moving them into a structure that is compatible with Siril.

Steps:

1. Add a new Dwarf telescope definition.
2. Select images to copy
3. Watch as the app does its stuff

Connecting to the Dwarf II
--------------------------
You connect to your Dwarf II in any of several ways:

1. Put the micro SD card in a card reading slot on your PC. In this case you get a drive letter and create a definition to access that drive.

2. Connect via Bluetooth. This is similar to the way the app connects.

3. Connect via IP address. This option is handy if you commonly use STA mode. If you can, configure your router to reserve the telescope's IP address so it always connects using the same one.

You may create as many telescope definitions as you wish to connect in different ways.
